# SPACEMAN ON A SPREE  
## BY MACK REYNOLDS  

What's more important—Man's conquest  
  
 of space, or one spaceman's life?  
I  
  
  
 They gave him a gold watch. It was meant to be symbolical, of course.  
 In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the  
 timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its  
 quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by  
 power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free  
 swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.  
  
  
 They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such  
 bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting  
 Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody  
 from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were  
 pseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travel  
 nor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother to  
 remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned  
 up at all.  
  
  
 In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations  
 before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible  
 in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to  
 his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.  
  
  
 The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them  
 back. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him  
 through decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards.  
 But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had  
 plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited  
 crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or  
 three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.  
  
  
 He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the  
 Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long  
 haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of  
 space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,  
 boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one  
 room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in  
 autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to  
 find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like  
 Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a  
 mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy  
 beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.  
  
  
 No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and  
 made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There  
 wasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to  
 keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He  
 was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking  
 about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.  
  
  
 They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.  
The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was  
 typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,  
 Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America  
 who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against  
 having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his  
 eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.  
  
  
 That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans  
 Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced  
 Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more  
 courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under  
 the Ultrawelfare State.  
  
  
 Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,  
 Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, "Any more  
 bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to  
 the cloddy's patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have  
 miserably failed."  
  
  
 Girard-Perregaux said easily, "I wouldn't call Seymour Pond a cloddy.  
 In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has."  
  
  
 "That's nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take  
 Pond's place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has  
 been trained. There aren't two men on North America—there aren't two  
 men in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our  
 delving into space." Gubelin snapped his fingers. "Like that, either of  
 us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the  
 road to his destiny."  
  
  
 His friend said drily, "Either of us could have volunteered for pilot  
 training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn't."  
  
  
 "At that time there wasn't such a blistering percentage of funkers  
 throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could  
 foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to  
 lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face  
 adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our  
 ancestors did?"  
  
  
 Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea  
 and tequila. He said, "Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the  
 present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one's  
 way of life in the comfort of one's home than to be confronted with  
 the unpleasantness of facing nature's dangers in more adventurous  
 pastimes."  
  
  
 Gubelin, half angry at his friend's argument, leaned forward to snap  
 rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. "Face  
 reality, Lofting. Don't require or expect from Seymour Pond more  
 than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our  
 Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb  
 security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our  
 society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,  
 clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level  
 of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted  
 into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the  
 population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude  
 dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was  
 you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out  
 the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six  
 trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable  
 life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the  
 very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.  
 He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years  
 of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he  
 made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was  
 drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now  
 free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to  
 our pleas for a few more trips?"  
  
  
 "But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for...."  
Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,  
 seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off  
 the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken  
 man.  
  
  
 He said, "No, he hasn't. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has  
 always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in  
 actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to  
 the least dangerous path. Today we've reached the point where no one  
 need face danger—ever. There are few who don't take advantage of the  
 fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond."  
  
  
 His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. "Let's  
 leave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to the  
 point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will  
 take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate  
 pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next  
 explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been  
 increasingly hard to come by—even though in  
our  
minds, Hans, we are  
 near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so  
 spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take  
 hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated  
 to the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well be  
 that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies  
 on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space  
 Exploration."  
  
  
 "So...." Girard-Perregaux said gently.  
  
  
 "So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!"  
  
  
 "Now we are getting to matters." Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.  
 Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his  
 face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. "And do not the ends  
 justify the means?"  
  
  
 Gubelin blinked at him.  
  
  
 The other chuckled. "The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have  
 failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven't you ever read  
 of the sailor and his way of life?"  
  
  
 "Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to  
 do with it?"  
  
  
 "You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more  
 than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,  
 tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never  
 heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his  
 birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at  
 sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out  
 for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk  
 of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be  
 one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and  
 heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning  
 would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in  
 jail. So back to sea he'd have to go."  
  
  
 Gubelin grunted bitterly. "Unfortunately, our present-day sailor  
 can't be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I'd  
 personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over  
 the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again."  
  
  
 He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his  
 universal credit card. "The ultimate means of exchange," he grunted.  
 "Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,  
 nobody can, ah,  
con  
you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever  
 our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?"  
  
  
 The other chuckled again. "It is simply a matter of finding more modern  
 methods, my dear chap."  
II  
  
  
 Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any  
 excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age  
 of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn't  
 been a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have his  
 name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.  
  
  
 When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications  
 were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in  
 the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training  
 for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had  
 taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed  
 the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It  
 had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty  
 take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.  
  
  
 Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,  
 a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of  
 dangers met and passed.  
  
  
 Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented  
 him from ever being called up for contributing to the country's labor  
 needs again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer.  
  
  
 He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn't  
 any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get the  
 reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the  
 fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or  
 not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn't you? What else did  
 you need?  
  
  
 It had come as a surprise when he'd been drafted for the labor force.  
  
  
 In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake  
 in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.  
 They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of  
 working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.  
 It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working  
 but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It  
 became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in  
 thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was  
 to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none  
 of them ever really becoming efficient.  
  
  
 The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain  
 unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of  
 unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a  
 reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year  
 and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees  
 were needed, a draft lottery was held.  
  
  
 All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you  
 were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen  
 might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were  
 granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks  
 they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the  
 dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be  
 sold for a lump sum on the market.  
  
  
 Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own  
 vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most  
 of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was  
 obviously called for.  
  
  
 He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He'd  
 accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended  
 to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card  
 was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he  
 wasn't going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.  
  
  
 Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,  
 fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third  
 rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you'd been in the  
 classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for  
 all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.  
  
  
 Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the  
 centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to  
 the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage's  
 profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets  
 quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who  
 must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and  
 usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent  
 hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long  
 denied him.  
  
  
 Si was going to do it differently this time.  
  
  
 Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The  
 works. But nothing but the best.  
To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable  
 retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he  
 attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.  
 A bit of prestige didn't hurt you when you went out on the town. In  
 the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever  
 performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren't  
 needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,  
 titles.  
  
  
 Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit  
 card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the  
 auto-apartment's teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the  
 screen and said, "Balance check, please."  
  
  
 In a moment, the teevee-phone's robot voice reported, "Ten shares of  
 Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four  
 thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents  
 apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars." The  
 screen went dead.  
  
  
 One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely  
 spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it  
 would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he  
 wouldn't have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond  
 was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.  
  
  
 He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube  
 two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down  
 the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one  
 place really made sense. The big city.  
  
  
 He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore  
 and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He  
 might as well do it up brown.  
  
  
 He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his  
 car's dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot  
 controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his  
 destination, he dialed the vehicle's teevee-phone for information on  
 the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry  
 he'd read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity  
 gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car's destination dial.  
  
  
 "Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond," he said aloud.  
  
  
 The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the  
 shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could  
 refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the  
 direction of the pressure was reversed.  
  
  
 Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing  
 sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the  
 canopy and stepped into his hotel room.  
  
  
 A voice said gently, "If the quarters are satisfactory, please present  
 your credit card within ten minutes."  
  
  
 Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most  
 swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size  
 the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to  
 the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the  
 Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched  
 the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.  
  
  
 He didn't take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining  
 table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,  
 he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn't plan to dine  
 or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he  
 managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.  
  
  
 He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped  
 himself happily onto the bed. It wasn't up to the degree of softness  
 he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that  
 direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the  
 mattress.  
  
  
 He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it  
 fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it  
 against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that  
 registration could be completed.  
  
  
 For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it  
 easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars  
 around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.  
 This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in  
 the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.  
  
  
 He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink  
 at the hotel's famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a  
 dime a dozen.  
  
  
 He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,  
 "Kudos Room."  
  
  
 The auto-elevator murmured politely, "Yes, sir, the Kudos Room."  
At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a  
 moment and looked about. He'd never been in a place like this, either.  
 However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was  
 going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made  
 his way to the bar.  
  
  
 There was actually a bartender.  
  
  
 Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an  
 air of easy sophistication, "Slivovitz Sour."  
  
  
 "Yes, sir."  
  
  
 The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed  
 they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.  
 He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the  
 drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so  
 as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.  
  
  
 Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he'd  
 dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining  
 conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up  
 to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to  
 take a look at the others present.  
  
  
 To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None  
 that he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the  
 Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.  
  
  
 He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl  
 who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked  
 and then swallowed.  
  
  
 "  
Zo-ro-as-ter  
," he breathed.  
  
  
 She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of  
 having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her  
 eyes. Every pore, but  
every  
pore, was in place. She sat with the easy  
 grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.  
  
  
 His stare couldn't be ignored.  
  
  
 She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, "A Far  
 Out Cooler, please, Fredric." Then deliberately added, "I thought the  
 Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive."  
  
  
 There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about  
 building the drink.  
  
  
 Si cleared his throat. "Hey," he said, "how about letting this one be  
 on me?"  
  
  
 Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her  
 Oriental motif, rose. "Really!" she said, drawing it out.  
  
  
 The bartender said hurriedly, "I beg your pardon, sir...."  
  
  
 The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, "Why, isn't that a  
 space pin?"  
  
  
 Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, "Yeah ... sure."  
  
  
 "Good Heavens, you're a spaceman?"  
  
  
 "Sure." He pointed at the lapel pin. "You can't wear one unless you  
 been on at least a Moon run."  
  
  
 She was obviously both taken back and impressed. "Why," she said,  
 "you're Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave  
 you."  
  
  
 Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. "Call me  
 Si," he said. "Everybody calls me Si."  
  
  
 She said, "I'm Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting  
 Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that."  
  
  
 "Si," Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he'd never seen anything  
 like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the  
 current sex symbols, but never in person. "Call me Si," he said again.  
 "I been called Si so long, I don't even know who somebody's talking to  
 if they say Seymour."  
  
  
 "I cried when they gave you that antique watch," she said, her tone  
 such that it was obvious she hadn't quite adjusted as yet to having  
 met him.  
  
  
 Si Pond was surprised. "Cried?" he said. "Well, why? I was kind of  
 bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under  
 him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it."  
  
  
 "  
Academician  
Gubelin?" she said. "You just call him  
Doc  
?"  
  
  
 Si was expansive. "Why, sure. In the Space Department we don't have  
 much time for formality. Everybody's just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like  
 that. But how come you cried?"  
She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,  
 as though avoiding his face. "I ... I suppose it was that speech  
 Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in  
 your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the  
 planets...."  
  
  
 "Well," Si said modestly, "two of my runs were only to the Moon."  
  
  
 "... and he said all those things about man's conquest of space. And  
 the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact  
 that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole  
 world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring."  
  
  
 Si grunted. "Yeah. That's all part of the Doc's scheme to get me to  
 take on another three runs. They're afraid the whole department'll be  
 dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning  
 Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,  
 it'd take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.  
 So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they're both trying to  
 pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration  
 Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their  
 ships. It's kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those  
 spaceships costs?"  
  
  
 "Funny?" she said. "Why, I don't think it's funny at all."  
  
  
 Si said, "Look, how about another drink?"  
  
  
 Natalie Paskov said, "Oh, I'd love to have a drink with you, Mr...."  
"Si," Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of  
 the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. "How come you  
 know so much about it? You don't meet many people who are interested  
 in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.  
 Think it's kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of  
 materials and all and keep the economy going."  
  
  
 Natalie said earnestly, "Why, I've been a space fan all my life. I've  
 read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots  
 and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you'd  
 say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about."  
  
  
 Si chuckled. "A real buff, eh? You know, it's kind of funny. I was  
 never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested  
 after my first run and I found out what space cafard was."  
  
  
 She frowned. "I don't believe I know much about that."  
  
  
 Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had  
 ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. "Old Gubelin  
 keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper  
 articles. Says there's enough adverse publicity about space exploration  
 already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship's crammed  
 tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there's  
 precious little room in the conning tower and you're the only man  
 aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there's a whole  
 flock of people aboard, there won't be any such thing as space cafard,  
 but...." Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond's mouth began to tic  
 and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.
